    "      <ul>\n",
    "          <li>The item should be readily available in decent condition for the seller to purchase at a low price but not so widely available that the market is saturated with that item.</li>\n",
    "          <li>there needs to be a demand for the item.</li>\n",
    "          <li>Be useful to a large number of people even in a used condition.</li>\n",
    "          <li>Be easy, cost effective and safe to ship.</li>\n",
    "      </ul>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "  <li>Buying at a cost low enough to make a profit: \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "          <li>Ebay takes about 13.5% of the sold price for brokering the sale.</li>\n",
    "          <li>Shipping costs and overhead fees can add up.</li>\n",
    "      </ul>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "  <li>The cost of excess inventory: \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "          <li>A seller can obtain quality items at a reasonable cost and then the inventory may sit with no sales, meaning the capital expended is sitting tied up in unwanted items. This inventory carry cost is a drain on profitability.</li>\n",

    "> A potential target that has been selling decently on the eBay store front from random sampling is something that has been overflowing out of bins at the State Surplus Store for years: pocketknives. Does this target answer all of the pain points above?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> I have been experimenting with low cost used knives for resale but have not risked a large capital investment in the higher end items. The goal of this project is to attempt to address the pain points to determine if a larger investment would pay off. Can I identify which knives are worth investing in so that I can turn a decent profit and hopefully avoid excess inventory? A data driven approach would help avoid costly mistakes from the \"system\"  currently employed, which seems to be mainly a gamblerâ€™s approach. By managing resources upfront through a model, I can effectively increase my return on investment with messy data such as pictures and titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are <mark>eight buckets</mark> of presorted brand knives that I was interested in, specifically. These bins are behind glass, presorted, branded(and therefore have specific characteristics and logos for my model to identify), and priced higher. However, the staff has a very large amount of confiscated items flowing into the facility to list for resale, and when that happens they will not have time to presort them and they end up in huge buckets of unsorted knives for people to dig through. The brands will be priced the same, they are just no longer sorted and harder to find. Expanding the bins to pull inventory from will increase the chance of finding inventory worth reselling, at the cost of time spent sorting the knives.\n",

    ">This project utilizes descriptive analysis to compare the profitability and return on investment for the 8 different brands avaialable for sale at the Texas State Surplus store. By examining different measures of centrality for previous prices sold on eBay in the past 2 years, the measure of variability, percentiles and also the construction of tables & graphs, it can be inferred which brands of knives to invest more heavily into and which ones to ignore completely at just a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> On top of descriptive analysis, the data will be used to train two different Neural Network models to predict the resale value of knives. The target feature for the model to predict is the total price (shipping included) that a knife should be listed on eBay. One model will be using titles and images in order to find potential listings that are undervalued and could be worth investing in. Another model will accept only images as input, as this is an input that can easily be obtained in person at the store. This model will use past sold data of knives on eBay in order to determine within an acceptable amount of error the price it will resale for on eBay (shipping included) using only an image. \n",
